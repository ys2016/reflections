1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	I think in this monent git creates an empty folder and an empty metadata structures.
	After, when I will add commits, this folder and metadata will be filled.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area allow us track not all files in working directory. It make sense especcially when we have large unchanged files in our program.
